      <strong>Explanation:</strong>

      Each ball has a unique photograph, which corresponds the country where I played. My high school soccer team from my final year
      is included in the photograph that corresponds with America. The photograph that corresponds with Germany
      was taken during my sophomore year when I played football in Munich, Germany. With Spain, my soccer team and I participated in Barcelona, Spain in 2017
