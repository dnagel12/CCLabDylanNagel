            <strong>Explanation:</strong> For my project, I had the intention of developing a project that would revolve
            around my love for soccer, a sport that I have been actively participating in for sixteen years. My goal was to
            provide a visual representation of the many different places I have visited, complete with photographs that are
            relevant to the topic and the countries that belong to it.
