            <strong>Explanation:</strong>

            At the time of scoring, each ball has a unique photograph; these photographs
            correspond to photographs taken at the country where I played. My high school soccer team from my final year
            is included in the photograph that corresponds with America. The photograph that corresponds with Germany
            was taken during my sophomore year of high school when I played football in Southern Munich, Germany. During
            that time, I had the opportunity to experience the way football is played in Europe. My soccer team and I
            participated in a competition in Spain in 2017, and the photo that corresponds with Barcelona, Spain was
            taken during that year.
