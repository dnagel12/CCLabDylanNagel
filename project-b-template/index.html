      <strong>Explanation:</strong> For my project, I had the intention of developing a project that would revolve
      around my love for soccer, a sport that I have been actively participating in for sixteen years. My goal was to
      provide a visual representation of the many different places I have visited, complete with photographs that are
      relevant to the topic and the countries that belong to it.
